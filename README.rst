==========================
JSON API client for Python
==========================

Introduction
============

Package repository: https://github.com/qvantel/jsonapi-client

This Python (3.6+) library provides easy-to-use, pythonic, ORM-like access to
JSON API ( http://jsonapi.org )

 - Optional asyncio implementation
 - Optional model schema definition and validation (=> easy reads even without schema)
 - Resource caching within session


Installation
============

From Pypi::

    pip install jsonapi-client

Or from sources::

    ./setup.py install


Usage
=====

Client session
--------------

.. code-block:: python

   from jsonapi_client import Session, Filter, ResourceTuple

   s = Session('http://localhost:8080/')
   # To start session in async mode
   s = Session('http://localhost:8080/', enable_async=True)

   # You can also pass extra arguments that are passed directly to requests or aiohttp methods,
   # such as authentication object
   s = Session('http://localhost:8080/',
               request_kwargs=dict(auth=HTTPBasicAuth('user', 'password'))


   # You can also use Session as a context manager. Changes are committed in the end
   # and session is closed.
   with Session(...) as s:
       your code

   # Or with enable_async=True
   async with Session(..., enable_async=True):
       your code

   # If you are not using context manager, you need to close session manually
   s.close()

   # Again, don't forget to await in the AsyncIO mode
   await s.close()

   # Fetching documents
   documents = s.get('resource_type')
   # Or if you want only 1, then
   documents = s.get('resource_type', 'id_of_document')

   # AsyncIO the same but remember to await:
   documents = await s.get('resource_type')

Filtering and including
-----------------------

.. code-block:: python

   # You need first to specify your filter instance.
   # - filtering with two criteria (and)
   filter = Filter(attribute='something', attribute2='something_else')
   # - filtering some-dict.some-attr == 'something'
   filter = Filter(some_dict__some_attr='something'))

   # Same thing goes for including.
   # - including two fields
   include = Inclusion('related_field', 'other_related_field')

   # Custom syntax for request parameters.
   # If you have different URL schema for filtering or other GET parameters,
   # you can implement your own Modifier class (derive it from Modifier and
   # reimplement appended_query).
   modifier = Modifier('filter[post]=1&filter[author]=2')

   # All above classes subclass Modifier and can be added to concatenate
   # parameters
   modifier_sum = filter + include + modifier

   # Now fetch your document
   filtered = s.get('resource_type', modifier_sum) # AsyncIO with await

   # To access resources included in document:
   r1 = document.resources[0]  # first ResourceObject of document.
   r2 = document.resource      # if there is only 1 resource we can use this

Pagination
----------

.. code-block:: python

   # Pagination links can be accessed via Document object.
   next_doc = document.links.next.fetch()
   # AsyncIO
   next_doc = await document.links.next.fetch()

   # Iteration through results (uses pagination):
   for r in s.iterate('resource_type'):
       print(r)

   # AsyncIO:
   async for r in s.iterate('resource_type'):
       print(r)

Resource attribute and relationship access
------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

   # - attribute access
   attr1 = r1.some_attr
   nested_attr = r1.some_dict.some_attr
   #   Attributes can always also be accessed via __getitem__:
   nested_attr = r1['some-dict']['some-attr']

   # If there is namespace collision, you can also access attributes via .fields proxy
   # (both attributes and relationships)
   attr2 = r1.fields.some_attr

   # - relationship access.
   #   * Sync, this gives directly ResourceObject
   rel = r1.some_relation
   attr3 = r1.some_relation.some_attr  # Relationship attribute can be accessed directly

   #   * AsyncIO, this gives Relationship object instead because we anyway need to
   #     call asynchronous fetch function.
   rel = r1.some_relation
   #     To access ResourceObject you need to first fetch content
   await r1.some_relation.fetch()
   #     and then you can access associated resourceobject
   res = r1.some_relation.resource
   attr3 = res.some_attr  # Attribute access through ResourceObject

   # If you need to access relatinoship object itself (with sync API), you can do it via
   # .relationships proxy. For example, if you are interested in links or metadata
   # provided within relationship, or intend to manipulate relationship.
   rel_obj = r1.relationships.relation_name

Resource updating
-----------------

.. code-block:: python

   # Updating / patching existing resources
   r1.some_attr = 'something else'
   # Patching element in nested json
   r1.some_dict.some_dict.some_attr = 'something else'

   # change relationships, to-many. Accepts also iterable of ResourceObjects/
   # ResourceIdentifiers/ResourceTuples
   r1.comments = ['1', '2']
   # or if resource type is not known or can have multiple types of resources
   r1.comments_or_people = [ResourceTuple('1', 'comments'), ResourceTuple('2', 'people')]
   # or if you want to add some resources you can
   r1.comments_or_people += [ResourceTuple('1', 'people')]
   r1.commit()

   # change to-one relationships
   r1.author = '3'  # accepts also ResourceObjects/ResourceIdentifiers/ResourceTuple
   # or resource type is not known (via schema etc.)
   r1.author = ResourceTuple('3', 'people')

   # Committing changes (PATCH request)
   r1.commit(meta={'some_meta': 'data'})  # Resource committing supports optional meta data
   # AsyncIO
   await r1.commit(meta={'some_meta': 'data'})


Creating new resources
----------------------


.. code-block:: python

   # Creating new resources. Schema must be given. Accepts dictionary of schema models
   # (key is model name and value is schema as json-schema.org).

   models_as_jsonschema = {
       'articles': {'properties': {
           'title': {'type': 'string'},
           'author': {'relation': 'to-one', 'resource': ['people']},
           'comments': {'relation': 'to-many', 'resource': ['comments']},
       }},
       'people': {'properties': {
           'first-name': {'type': 'string'},
           'last-name': {'type': 'string'},
           'twitter': {'type': ['null', 'string']},
       }},
       'comments': {'properties': {
           'body': {'type': 'string'},
        'author': {'relation': 'to-one', 'resource': ['people']}
    }}
   }
   # If you type schema by hand, it could be more convenient to type it as yml in a file
   # instead

   s = Session('http://localhost:8080/', schema=models_as_jsonschema)
   a = s.create('articles') # Creates empty ResourceObject of 'articles' type
   a.title = 'Test title'

   # Validates and performs POST request, and finally updates resource based on server response
   a.commit(meta={'some_meta': 'data'})
   # Or with AsyncIO, remember to await
   await a.commit(meta={'some_meta': 'data'})

   # Commit metadata could be also saved in advance:
   a.commit_metadata = {'some_meta': 'data'}
   # You can also commit all changed resources in session by
   s.commit()
   # or with AsyncIO
   await s.commit()

   # Another example of resource creation, setting attributes and relationships & committing:
   # If you have underscores in your field names, you can pass them in fields keyword argument as
   # a dictionary:
   cust1 = s.create_and_commit('articles',
                               attribute='1',
                               dict_object__attribute='2',
                               to_one_relationship='3',
                               to_many_relationship=['1', '2'],
                               fields={'some_field_with_underscore': '1'}
                               )

   # Async:
   cust1 = await s.create_and_commit('articles',
                                     attribute='1',
                                     dict_object__attribute='2',
                                     to_one_relationship='3',
                                     to_many_relationship=['1', '2'],
                                     fields={'some_field_with_underscore': '1'}
                                     )

Deleting resources
------------------

.. code-block:: python

    # Delete resource
    cust1.delete() # Mark to be deleted
    cust1.commit() # Actually delete


Session history for debugging
------------------

.. code-block:: python

    # You can use session history to debug http requests.
    # Session history will be enabled by initialising session with enable_history=True parameter.

    # Session history will be enabled by: (Python log level is WARNING by default)
    s = Session('http://localhost:8080/', schema=models_as_jsonschema,
                enable_history=True)

    # Session history is a list of session history items.
    # You can see the information about the request and response
    # For example
    s.history.latest
    # will print out some data about the latest request
    # That actually equals to
    s.history[-1]

    # You can see the latest server response by
    print(s.history.latest.response_content)
    # or to see the response headers
    s.history.latest.headers


Event hooks
------------------

.. code-block:: python

    # Another way to implement debugging is to use event hooks.
    # The event hooks of the underlaying aiohttp or requests libraries can
    # be used as such by passing them as event_hooks argument as a dict.

    # For example if you want to print all the sent data on console at async mode, you can use the
    # 'on_request_chunk_sent' event hook https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/tracing_reference.html#aiohttp.TraceConfig.on_request_chunk_sent

    import asyncio
    async def sent(session, context, params):
        print(f'sent {params.chunk}')

    s = Session(
        'http://0.0.0.0:8090/api',
        enable_async=True,
        schema=models_as_jsonschema,
        event_hooks={'on_request_chunk_sent': sent}
    )
    await s.get('some-collection')
    await s.close()

    # On sychronous mode the available event hooks are listed here https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/advanced/#event-hooks
